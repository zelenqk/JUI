now i have the idea and whatnot and i will plan to make my own scribble like system so i could add a sanitize entry to not parse anything past it so as to prevent any exploits if used by users and whatnot

JUI is a static, style-oriented UI system designed for functionality and efficiency. Every container is baked after creation, meaning any changes require re-calculation or re-rendering, which can be expensive. JUI prioritizes performance over modularity, focusing on fast, optimized rendering rather than dynamic layouts.
